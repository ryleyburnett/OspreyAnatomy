There are 5 steps to using this plugin.

step 1:
	Add the script "CustomIKJoint" to any joint you wish to be affected by the IK.
step 2:
	Add the script "CustomIKSolver" to any object you want, generally I place it on the armature or target.
step 3:
	Add all of the joints to the IK Solver that you want to use, you do so by clicking the joints button and pressing ADD.
step 4:
	Set the Ankle variable on the IK solver to be the transform of the end point of your joint chain.
step 5:
	Set the target to any object you want it to point at.

Thats it! press play and you should see your joints moving into position.
